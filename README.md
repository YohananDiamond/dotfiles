# dotfiles

This repository contain my config for bash, neovim, tmux, vscode, termux and other programs.

## Folder structure

- `config`: config files, mostly stored in ~/.config and the hidden ones in ~;
- `local`: contains directories that have their files symlinked to ~/.local/\<dirname\>;
- `templates`: template files that are useful for me (e.g. simple C makefiles);

## Trying it out

While this is open for everyone to access, I don't recommend simply copying these files.
I believe it's better for you to only get what you need from these files and slowly add what you *want* and *understand* to your own setup.

Also, there usually are a lot of frequent and unstable commits, since I use git and GitHub themselves to sync with my phone, but most of them are on the `nightly` branch.

But if you want to use it anyways or simply take a look on how it works:

```
./sync
```

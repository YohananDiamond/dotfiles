# dotfiles

This repository contain my config for many programs, like bash, zsh, neovim, tmux, termux etc.

It also has configuration for my Arch Linux environment - Xorg,
bspwm, sxhkd etc.

## Folder structure

- `config`: config files, mostly stored in `~/.config` and the hidden ones in `~`;
- `local`: contains directories that have their files symlinked to `~/.local/<dirname>`;

## Trying it out

While this is open for everyone to access, I don't recommend simply copying these files.
I believe it's better for you to only get what you need from these files and slowly add what you *want* and *understand* to your own setup.

But if you want to use it anyways or simply take a look on how it works:

```
./sync
```
